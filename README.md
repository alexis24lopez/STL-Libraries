# STL-Libraries
Coded the standard template library for several libraries eg: string, vector, tree, and so on

Note: The code and test programs are on the STL [name] folders. How to execute them 
      is located on the STL [name] how to compile and run folder.
      
Note: The name of folder should had been STL NOT STD. I'll Fix the typo later! :)
